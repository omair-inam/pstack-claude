# pstack for Claude Code, Codex, Prime Agent, opencode, and Gemini CLI

Claude Code port of [poteto](https://x.com/poteto)'s [pstack](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack) plugin. The skill tree is synced against upstream `7314f72`, pstack v0.14.8. See [What's deliberately not ported](#whats-deliberately-not-ported). The same `skills/` tree ships as a Codex plugin and is discovered natively by [Prime Agent](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-agent), [opencode](#opencode), and [Gemini CLI](#gemini-cli). Original by Lauren Tan; ships MIT. Imports seven skills from [cursor-team-kit](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/cursor-team-kit) (also MIT): `deslop`, `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review`, `make-pr-easy-to-review`, `fix-ci`, `fix-merge-conflicts`, `get-pr-comments`, `what-did-i-get-done`.

> if you want to go fast, go deep first. pstack helps you write less, but higher quality code. rigorous agent workflows you can parallelize with confidence.

This is not a verbatim copy. Skill bodies have been edited so every Cursor-specific primitive resolves to its Claude Code equivalent — see [Differences from upstream](#differences-from-upstream) for the full list. The exhaustive per-skill audit lives in [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md); license attribution and the upstream pins live in [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md) and `tools/upstream.json`.

## Install

### Claude Code

This repo ships as a Claude Code marketplace containing one plugin (`pstack`).

```shell
/plugin marketplace add michael-denyer/pstack-claude
/plugin install pstack@pstack-claude
```

From 0.9.5 the plugin auto-fires, the same way superpowers does: a `SessionStart` hook (on `startup`, `/clear`, and post-`compact`) injects a ~0.3k-token mandate that routes any non-trivial engineering task into `poteto-mode` before the first response. The full skill still loads only on invoke. Dispatched subagents are told to ignore the mandate, and explicit user instructions take precedence. To opt out, delete `hooks/hooks.json` from the installed copy (`~/.claude/plugins/cache/pstack-claude/pstack/<version>/hooks/hooks.json`); a plugin update restores it.

### Shared Agent Skills install

Codex, Prime Agent, opencode, and Gemini CLI all discover user skills from `~/.agents/skills/`. Clone the repository and link its shared skill tree once:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/michael-denyer/pstack-claude
cd pstack-claude
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
for s in plugins/pstack/skills/*/; do ln -s "$PWD/$s" ~/.agents/skills/"$(basename "$s")"; done
```

The loop links all 52 skill directories. Thirty-one are public workflows and 21 `principle-*` directories are internal references used by `poteto-mode`. Each runtime decides whether it understands pstack-specific frontmatter such as `user-invocable: false`, so menu visibility differs. Keep the principle directories installed even when a runtime lists them.

Removing a link from `~/.agents/skills/` removes that skill from every runtime using the shared directory. Teardown is `rm ~/.agents/skills/<name>`.

The [`skills` CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) installs the same tree without a clone, resolving `plugins/pstack/skills` as a subtree URL:

```shell
npx skills add https://github.com/michael-denyer/pstack-claude/tree/main/plugins/pstack/skills --skill "*" --agent "*" --yes
```

`plugins/pstack/skills` is a supported installation boundary. Everything a skill reads at runtime lives inside it, including the `poteto-agent` and `comment-sicko` definitions under `poteto-mode/references/agents/` and the MIT terms under `poteto-mode/references/licenses/`. Both directories sit inside a skill because the CLI installs skill directories and drops loose files at the tree root. The generator stamps exactly five portable assets from the sources declared in `PORTABLE_ASSETS` and removes stale output from those two generated directories. It rejects missing or escaping local Markdown links and direct instructions to open paths outside the skills tree. The `Skills-only install` CI job copies the tree with the CLI, compares every installed file with the source, and runs the same validation against the installed tree.

Three plugin features do not survive a skills-only install, because they belong to a specific runtime rather than to the skills. Claude Code's `SessionStart` auto-fire lives in `hooks/`, the Codex slash-command stubs live in `.codex-plugin/prompts/`, and Claude Code's native subagent registration reads `agents/`. On a skills-only install, dispatch `comment-sicko` by pointing the runtime's agent primitive at `poteto-mode/references/agents/comment-sicko.md`.

### Codex

The same plugin carries a `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` manifest and a root `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`. Use the [shared Agent Skills install](#shared-agent-skills-install). This path is verified on a live Codex session.

Codex discovers the linked skills and namespaces them under the plugin, so they list as `pstack:poteto-mode`, `pstack:tdd`, and so on. The namespace comes from `plugins/pstack/.codex-plugin/plugin.json` and resolves through the flat symlinks, even though each linked skill sits one directory below that manifest (verified on a live session via this symlink install). To enable the multi-model and parallel-subagent skills (`interrogate`, `arena`, `how`, `why`, `reflect`, `architect`), turn on subagents in `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[features]
multi_agent = true
```

For slash-command shortcuts (`/poteto-mode`, `/tdd`, and the rest), link the command files into Codex's prompts directory:

```shell
mkdir -p ~/.codex/prompts
for c in plugins/pstack/.codex-plugin/prompts/*.md; do ln -s "$PWD/$c" ~/.codex/prompts/"$(basename "$c")"; done
```

Each command invokes its skill, so `/tdd` runs the `tdd` skill. Installing the full plugin through the Codex marketplace (the root `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`) carries skills and commands together. The skill links plus prompt links are the verified local path. Teardown for a prompt is `rm ~/.codex/prompts/<name>.md`.

### Prime Agent

[Prime Agent](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-agent) discovers skills from `~/.agents/skills/` and from `.agents/skills/` in the working tree up to the git root ([docs](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-agent/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/docs/skills.md)). The [shared Agent Skills install](#shared-agent-skills-install) is the complete Prime install.

pstack's `SKILL.md` frontmatter is a subset of what Prime reads: it requires `name` (lowercase, matching the parent directory — every pstack skill already conforms) and `description`, honours `disable-model-invocation`, and ignores unknown keys such as pstack's `user-invocable`. `curl -fsSL https://app.primeintellect.ai/prime-agent/install.sh | sh` installs Prime itself; `--no-skills` disables discovery, and explicit `--skill <path>` still loads. Prime is model-agnostic, so running these skills against **ChatGPT / OpenAI models is a Prime backend setting, not a plugin change** — keep the multi-model panels in `arena`, `interrogate`, `architect`, and `how` genuinely diverse across whatever models you configure (see the OpenAI panel note under [Running on Codex](#running-on-codex)).

Unverified relative to Codex: the Prime path is derived from Prime's documented discovery paths and frontmatter schema, not yet run on a live Prime session. Prime has no plugin-hook runtime, so the Claude Code auto-fire hook does not apply. Enter `pstack:poteto-mode` by name or add a standing routing instruction to your Prime config.

### opencode

[opencode](https://opencode.ai/docs/skills) loads Agent Skills from `~/.agents/skills/` as well as its own `~/.config/opencode/skills/` directory. Use the [shared Agent Skills install](#shared-agent-skills-install). There is nothing to generate.

opencode ignores the pstack-specific `user-invocable: false` key, so its picker lists the 21 `principle-*` leaves alongside the 31 public workflows. Codex and Claude Code hide the leaves. Keep them linked because `poteto-mode` cites them by name and expects to read each one.

The opencode path is verified on a live opencode 1.18.25 session. It discovers all 31 public skills through the links and reads a linked `SKILL.md` on request. Agents, commands, and permissions are configured in `opencode.json`.

### Gemini CLI

[Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/cli/using-agent-skills.md) has native Agent Skills. It discovers user skills from `~/.gemini/skills/` or the `~/.agents/skills/` compatibility alias. Use the [shared Agent Skills install](#shared-agent-skills-install), then run `/skills list` to inspect discovery or `/skills reload` after changing a linked file. Ask Gemini to use `poteto-mode`; its `activate_skill` tool loads the skill and its resources.

The Gemini path follows published Gemini CLI documentation and has not been run on a live session. Neither Gemini CLI nor opencode gets generated command files. Native discovery keeps each `SKILL.md`, its references, and its scripts attached to one installed directory, so the skills work from the repository where the user actually needs them.

Discovery is not a promise that Claude-specific execution details translate automatically. The skill bodies retain Claude Code tool names, `claude-*` model slugs, and Claude built-in skills. [`codex-tools.md`](plugins/pstack/skills/poteto-mode/references/codex-tools.md) maps those names on Codex only. Gemini CLI, opencode, and Prime Agent must use their own tool, model, and configuration equivalents. Delegation-heavy and multi-model workflows remain unverified on those runtimes. None has a plugin-hook equivalent of the Claude Code auto-fire hook, so ask the runtime to use `poteto-mode` explicitly.

## Running on Codex

The Codex and Claude Code builds use the same `skills/` tree. Codex-specific generation adds prompt stubs from each skill's `menu-description` frontmatter. The shared generator also stamps manifest versions, model-policy sections, the README command table, and five portable assets. One mapping file handles the Claude-to-Codex translation, the same structure `superpowers` uses for Codex. pstack diverges in one respect. superpowers writes its skills in tool-neutral language, so no skill names a runtime tool. pstack keeps the upstream Claude-native prose and adds a one-line Platform note to each skill that names a Claude primitive, so the port stays in lockstep with upstream sync.

- **Skill invocation.** Codex loads `SKILL.md` natively. There is no `Skill` tool. You invoke a skill by name (ask for it, or pick `pstack:poteto-mode` from the list).
- **Commands.** The 31 `.codex-plugin/prompts/*.md` files are Codex-only, generated by `tools/generate.mjs` from each public skill's `menu-description` frontmatter (edit the skill, rerun the generator; hand edits to a stub are overwritten). Codex reads their `description` frontmatter and the filename, ignores the keys it doesn't know, and each body invokes its skill. Link them into `~/.codex/prompts/` for `/name` shortcuts (see [Install on Codex](#codex)). Claude Code ships no `commands/` directory: it renders both commands and user-invocable skills in the slash menu, so a trampoline paired with its skill duplicated every `/pstack:<name>` row (see CHANGES 0.9.13). The skill alone serves the slash command there.
- **Tool, model, and built-in mapping.** When a skill names a Claude tool (the `Agent` tool, `AskUserQuestion`), a `claude-*` model slug, or a Claude built-in skill (`run`, `verify`, `loop`, `plugin-dev:skill-development`), it resolves through [`skills/poteto-mode/references/codex-tools.md`](plugins/pstack/skills/poteto-mode/references/codex-tools.md). `poteto-mode` and every skill that names one of those carries a one-line **Platform note** pointing there.
- **Subagents.** The `Agent` tool maps to Codex `spawn_agent` / `wait_agent` / `close_agent`, enabled by `multi_agent = true`. Parallel fan-out is multiple `spawn_agent` calls in one turn. Without the flag, `interrogate`, `arena`, `how`, `why`, `reflect`, and `architect` degrade to a single sequential pass. There is no `poteto-agent` subagent type on Codex; route ad-hoc subagents by dispatching a `spawn_agent` told to read `poteto-mode` first.
- **Auto-fire.** The `hooks/` SessionStart injection is Claude Code-only; Codex has no plugin hook runtime. Enter `pstack:poteto-mode` by name, or add a standing instruction to `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` if you want the same always-on routing.
- **Models.** The `claude-*` slugs in skills are Claude defaults, stamped into each skill's Models section from `plugins/pstack/models.json`. On Codex substitute your configured Codex models, keeping multi-model panels genuinely diverse. `/setup-pstack` writes `~/.codex/pstack-models.md` (referenced from `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`) with Codex slugs instead of `~/.claude/pstack-models.md`.

Verified on a live Codex session installed via the symlinks: the user-facing skills are discovered and namespaced under `pstack` (`pstack:poteto-mode`, `pstack:interrogate`, and so on). The `principle-*` leaf skills carry `user-invocable: false` and no command, so Codex does not surface them in the picker, the same as Claude Code. They stay installed for `poteto-mode` to read by path. The deeper behaviors (mapping resolution mid-task, `spawn_agent` fan-out) follow the proven `superpowers` pattern and are worth confirming in your own session.

## CI

`ci.yml` and `security.yml` run on every pull request and push to `main`. `dependabot-lockfile.yml` also triggers on every pull request, but its only job runs when Dependabot authored the PR.

`ci.yml` runs five jobs. The static plugin invariants run `tests/skill-collision-repro.sh` under `SKIP_BEHAVIORAL=1`, since the behavioral leg needs the `claude` CLI and API access. The generated-files job runs `bun tools/generate.mjs`, rejects a resulting diff, and runs the Bun tests. The skills-only job installs through the `skills` CLI, compares the copied tree with the source, and checks for missing or escaping Markdown links and direct instructions to open unreachable paths. The other jobs test the vendored Bun tooling and run `shellcheck` over scripts selected by extension or shebang, so the extensionless hook scripts are covered.

`security.yml` runs `osv-scanner` against the lockfiles and fails the build if no lockfile was found, because an empty scan reads exactly like a clean one. It also rejects any action reference not pinned to a full 40-character commit SHA. It runs weekly on top of the per-PR trigger, so a CVE published after a merge still surfaces. `zizmor` audits the workflows themselves for template injection, over-broad permissions, and credential persistence.

Dependabot keeps the pinned SHAs and the bun dependencies current, on a 7-day cooldown so a compromised release has time to be reported before a PR opens. Because Dependabot cannot regenerate `bun.lock`, `dependabot-lockfile.yml` does it for its PRs and pushes the result back to the branch.

Before a release, run the full `tests/skill-collision-repro.sh` locally (without `SKIP_BEHAVIORAL`) to exercise the behavioral leg CI cannot.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the sync boundary, the local checks to run, and the release rules.

## Dependencies

Nothing is declared in `plugin.json`. Install the one companion plugin yourself:

- **`plugin-dev`** (from the `claude-plugins-official` marketplace) — the rewiring routes skill-authoring tasks (in `automate-me`, `reflect`, `poteto-mode`) to the `plugin-dev:skill-development` skill:

  ```shell
  /plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-plugins-official
  /plugin install plugin-dev@claude-plugins-official
  ```

  Until 0.9.2 this was a `dependencies` entry in `plugin.json`. The desktop app's `--plugin-dir` load mode can never resolve cross-marketplace dependencies and hard-disables the whole plugin, so 0.9.3 removed the declaration — full mechanism in the 0.9.3 entry of [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md). Without `plugin-dev` installed, only the skill-authoring routes degrade; everything else works.

Not declared as deps, but referenced in skill bodies:

- **`run`, `verify`, `loop`** — Claude Code CLI built-ins (ship with the binary, always available).
- **`gh` CLI** — system-level requirement of the `babysit` skill and the Babysit / Shipping playbooks. Install via [`brew install gh`](https://cli.github.com) and authenticate with `gh auth login`.
- **`bun`** — runs the vendored `skills/poteto-mode/scripts/` tooling (`watch-pr`, `orch`). Install via [`brew install oven-sh/bun/bun`](https://bun.sh). Only the playbooks that call those scripts need it; `bootstrap.ts` installs the script dependencies on first run.
- **`gt` (Graphite CLI)** — optional. Since 0.9.19 the stack playbooks (Shipping, the autopilots) land base-branch chains with `gh` alone and never require Graphite. Only the Orchestrate playbook and its `orch` store CLI still use `gt`.
- **`jq` and `rg` (ripgrep)** — only for `scripts/worktree-audit.sh` (the Worktree cleanup playbook). Without them the audit still runs but blanks its PR and LAST_CHAT columns, so it warns on stderr rather than returning a table that looks complete.

No third-party plugins. The harsher-critique escape hatch lives in the bundled `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review` skill (imported from cursor-team-kit), not in an external plugin.

## Subagents

`poteto-agent` ships unchanged. Spawn from a parent with `subagent_type: "poteto-agent"`.

`comment-sicko` is the read-only comment reviewer the `no-comments` skill spawns. Upstream names it `Comment Sicko`; the port renames it to `comment-sicko` so the name is a valid `subagent_type`. Invoke it through `/no-comments`, not directly.

## Differences from upstream

The port is editorial, not mechanical. Anywhere upstream pstack assumed Cursor-specific primitives, this port substitutes the Claude Code equivalent so refs actually resolve. Two prior ports ([v1truv1us/ai-eng-system](https://github.com/v1truv1us/ai-eng-system), [Evan-Kim2028/agent-fleet](https://github.com/Evan-Kim2028/agent-fleet)) stop at namespacing — they vendor pstack under `pstack/` and leave the Cursor refs intact. This port does the content surgery.

### What's added

- **`skills/babysit/`** — Claude Code analog of Cursor's closed-source `/babysit` built-in. Wraps `gh pr view` / `gh pr checks` / `gh run view --log-failed` plus the `loop` skill for pacing. Independently authored; workflow informed by Cursor's public `/babysit` behavior — not a copy of Cursor's implementation. Since the v0.14.2 sync, poteto-mode routes PR-status requests to the ported `playbooks/babysit.md` instead, and this skill is the standalone `/babysit` entry point.
- **`skills/deslop/`** — imported verbatim from `cursor-team-kit`. Cleans AI tells out of diffs before commit.
- **`skills/thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review/`** — imported verbatim from `cursor-team-kit`. Used as the harsher-critique escape hatch in `arena`, `interrogate`, `architect`, and `how` (replaces the Cursor-original cross-vendor bridge).
- **`skills/make-pr-easy-to-review/`** — imported verbatim from `cursor-team-kit`. Composes with `opening-a-pr` and `babysit`.
- **`skills/fix-ci/`** — imported verbatim from `cursor-team-kit`. Narrower CI-fix primitive that `babysit` can route to.
- **`skills/fix-merge-conflicts/`** — imported verbatim from `cursor-team-kit`. Pairs with `babysit` step 5.
- **`skills/get-pr-comments/`** — imported verbatim from `cursor-team-kit`. Primitive for `babysit` step 4 and `reflect`.
- **`skills/what-did-i-get-done/`** — imported verbatim from `cursor-team-kit`. Commit summary over a chosen period.

### What's substituted in skill bodies

| Upstream (Cursor) | This port (Claude Code) |
| --- | --- |
| `Task` tool, `subagent_type: generalPurpose`, `readonly: false/true` | `Agent` tool, `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`, no readonly flag (subagent_type controls MCP access) |
| `AskQuestion` tool | `AskUserQuestion` tool |
| Cursor's built-in `/loop` | Claude Code's built-in `loop` skill |
| Cursor's built-in `/babysit` | `babysit` skill bundled in this plugin. From v0.14.0 upstream routes PR-status requests inside poteto-mode to `playbooks/babysit.md` instead; the port does the same, and `/babysit` stays the standalone entry point |
| Cursor's built-in `/create-skill` | `plugin-dev:skill-development` skill |
| `cursor-team-kit` `control-cli` (CLI/TUI driver) | Claude Code's `run` skill |
| `cursor-team-kit` `control-ui` (browser/Electron driver) | Claude Code's `verify` skill |
| Transcripts at `~/.cursor/projects/*/` or `agent-transcripts/` | `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/*.jsonl` (where `<encoded-cwd>` is the workspace cwd with `/` → `-`) |
| Skill paths `.cursor/skills/`, `~/.cursor/plugins/` | `.claude/skills/`, `~/.claude/plugins/` |
| MCP discovery via Cursor's `mcps/` directory | Tool list at top of system prompt (`mcp__<server>__<name>` entries), or `.mcp.json`, or `claude mcp list` |
| Cursor cloud agents (`environment: "cloud"`, `cloud_base_branch`) | Local background subagents (`run_in_background: true`), isolated by git worktree |
| Cursor's `/goal` (standing objective across turns) | The program objective written into the run's standing orders and restated in the todolist |
| The Cursor agent store (path in the system prompt) | `~/.claude/orchestrate/<project-slug>/`, which survives the session restarts a multi-day program expects |
| Model rule `~/.cursor/rules/pstack-models.mdc` | Override sheet `~/.claude/pstack-models.md`, included from `CLAUDE.md` |
| Model `composer-2.5-fast` (Cursor) | `claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| Model `claude-opus-4-X-thinking-xhigh` (Cursor UI variant) | `claude-opus-5` (extended thinking configured separately) |
| Models `gpt-5.3-codex-high-fast`, `gpt-5.5-high-fast` (via Cursor) | `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-haiku-4-5` (Claude family) |
| Multi-model panels (arena, architect, interrogate, how-critics) | Default panel is `claude-opus-5` + `claude-fable-5-1` + `claude-sonnet-5` — three distinct models across three tiers (replaces the cross-vendor diversity lost in translation). |

### What's lost in translation

**Cross-vendor model diversity.** `arena`, `interrogate`, `architect`, and `how` all rely on stress-testing a design against several *different* model families. Claude Code is single-vendor, so the split collapses to three Claude variants by tier. Instead of bridging to an external CLI for that diversity, the rewiring routes the "harsher pass" to the bundled `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review` skill — different style of pressure (strict maintainability rubric), not vendor diversity, but it lives in-plugin with no extra installs.

### What's deliberately kept

- The `poteto-agent` subagent ID and all references to it.
- `run_in_background: true` on Agent calls (Claude Code supports it).
- `/loop`, `/deslop`, `/babysit` slash references in skill bodies — they all resolve in Claude Code now.
- The principle/playbook structure and every word of the principles themselves.

### What's deliberately not ported

- **`automations/benny/`** (upstream `0452e08`, the only pstack change between `e46364b` and v0.10.0) — a dormant Slack issue-triage and reproduce-and-fix automation pack built on Cursor's event-triggered automations. It registers no slash skills even upstream, so excluding it changes nothing about the ported plugin's behavior. Porting it would mean translating Cursor's event-trigger runtime to Claude Code's polling-based scheduled agents plus Slack and tracker plumbing — speculative infrastructure with no local user. Revisit if an unattended issue-intake stream materialises; the likely first step is porting the triage skill onto a single Claude scheduled agent, not the whole pack.
- **`docs/guide/`** (upstream `02c03a9`, `0b7ef5b`, `424829e`) — the ten-chapter usage tutorial and its six screenshots (2.3 MB). It teaches pstack through Cursor's UI, sticky mode, and cloud agents, so a faithful port would be a rewrite rather than a sync, and none of it ships as skill content. Read it upstream at [cursor/plugins/pstack/docs/guide](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack/docs/guide); the concepts map through the substitution table above. Revisit if the port grows its own tutorial.
- **Sticky mode** (upstream `#144`) — Cursor-only `mode`/`icon`/`color`/`reminder` frontmatter with no Claude Code equivalent. The port's 0.9.5 SessionStart hook is the analog and already carries the non-trivial / trivial / opt-out logic.
- **`is_background: true` on `poteto-agent`** (upstream `99559f2`) — Cursor subagent frontmatter. Claude Code's agent frontmatter has no such key, and `run_in_background: true` on the spawning `Agent` call already covers it.
- **`skills/make-bot-ui/`** (upstream `799151d`, `6fecddb`, v0.14.4) — builds a web page that wakes a Grok Bot through a webhook routine. Every step calls Cursor's `update_state` tool to create the routine, reads the sender key off Cursor's routine panel, and exposes the page on Tailscale. Claude Code has no routine or secret store to point those steps at, so there is nothing to translate; the sync denylist now flags `update_state` and `Grok Bot` so a future sync reports the skill instead of writing it.
- **`cursor-team-kit` beyond the seven imported skills** — the rest either duplicate Claude Code built-ins (`verify-this` → the `verify` skill and built-in verification discipline; `check-compiler-errors` → LSP diagnostics; `control-cli`/`control-ui` → `run`/`verify`, already the substitution targets) or overlap skills this port ships (`loop-on-ci`, `review-and-ship`, `weekly-review` vs `babysit`, `fix-ci`, `make-pr-easy-to-review`, `what-did-i-get-done`). `pr-review-canvas` is Cursor-UI-specific.

### Forking note

Editing skill bodies forks this from upstream. Re-syncing to a future pstack release means re-applying the substitution table. The full re-port recipe is in [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md).
